# 03-Text-adventure

This is my solution to the 03-Text adventure assignment for MSCH-C220. I have included a couple of .json game description files for anyone to play with.

main_simple.py contains the code we worked out in class (or a close approximation to it). It runs the zork.json file, as long as it is in the same directory.

main.py is a little more complicated. 

Features to add at some point
 * Objects in the world
 * inventory management
 * Points (for objects acquired or locations visited)
 * Flags for accomplished events
 * Conditional exits (based on flags)
 * etc.



 I edited the .json file for my game to include locations that i described in my own words, building an interactive world that grows increasingly stranger as you progress. I attempted to implement a sort of inventory system, where each location has some sort of interactive item collection or something of the sort. I also tried to build some sort of tension/intrigue around the world that I've (with limited functionality and resources) built. The majority of my work was getting the hang of how to edit the json files and how to implement the things I wanted to, although not everything was able to be done with my current understanding.
